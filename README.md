## How to Use

### 1. **Prerequisites:**

No external setup is required as the script handles all necessary dependencies. Ensure you have **R** installed.

### 2. **Steps to Run:**

     Open code/code.r in RStudio or your preferred IDE.
     Run the script directly to:
         Install required libraries using pacman.
         Load and preprocess the dataset (data/train.json).
         Generate frequent itemsets and association rules using the Apriori algorithm.
         Visualize the item frequency and rule relationships.

### 3. **Project Report:**

Refer to `Report.docx` for detailed analysis and findings.
